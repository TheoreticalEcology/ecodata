A 'data.frame':	146,028 obs. of  28 variables:
\describe{
  \item{playershort}{short player ID}
  \item{player}{player name}
  \item{club}{player club}
  \item{leagueCountry}{country of player club (England, Germany, France, and Spain)}
  \item{birthday}{player birthday}
  \item{height}{player height (in cm)}
  \item{weight}{player weight (in kg)}
  \item{position}{detailed player position}
  \item{games}{number of games in the player-referee dyad}
  \item{victories}{victories in the player-referee dyad}
  \item{ties}{ties in the player-referee dyad}
  \item{defeats}{losses in the player-referee dyad}
  \item{goals}{goals scored by a player in the player-referee dyad}
  \item{yellowCards}{number of yellow cards player received from referee}
  \item{yellowReds}{number of yellow-red cards player received from referee}
  \item{redCards}{number of red cards player received from referee}
  \item{photoID}{ID of player photo (if available)}
  \item{rater1}{skin rating of photo by rater 1 (5-point scale ranging from very light skin, to very dark skin)}
  \item{rater2}{skin rating of photo by rater 2 (5-point scale ranging from very light skin, to very dark skin)}
  \item{refNum}{unique referee ID number (referee name removed for anonymizing purposes)}

  \item{seIAT}{standard error for mean estimate of race IAT }
  \item{meanExp}{mean explicit bias score (using a racial thermometer task) for referee country, higher values correspond to greater feelings of warmth toward whites versus blacks}
  \item{nExp}{sample size for explicit bias in that particular country}
  \item{seExp}{standard error for mean estimate of explicit bias measure}

\usage{
redCards
}
\description{
This is a dataset from the English premier league. The data was compiled to test if soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players than to light-skin-toned players.
}
\details{
The data was analyzed in a many-analyset project. The estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 (Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31%) did not observe a significant relationship. The variation is explained by the statistical approach and the choice of predictor variables
