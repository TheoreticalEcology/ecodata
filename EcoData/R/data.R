#' Volcano island
#'
#' Ecological observatins on a lonely volcano island.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' We are looking at the Maunga Whau (Mt Eden), one of about 50 volcanos in the Auckland volcanic field.
#'
#' A crazy ecologist has created 100 permanent beetle observation plots arcross the volcano (random), and monitored them for 10 years, so you have one observation each year. Below a visualization of the terrain
#'
#' We have also a bunch of other things going on. For example,
#'
#' * Actually, we have two types of beetles. The second type is much more complicated, I'm curious if you find out what's going on with them
#'
#' * There is the wind, which might depend on other variables
#'
#' * There are lizards on the island that eat beetles. The lizards always live at the same place, however, they are hard to spot, so that the ecologist didn't always notice them. However, every time they were spotted, they were also observed.
#'
#' * Moreover, the ecologist also did a beetle survival study each year at each site. Don't ask me how he did it, but you have get for each year and each site how many of 20 beetles survived.
#'
#' The main question of the study was to understand how beetle abudance depends on altitude. Here is an overview of counts per site and year.

#' From Wikipedia:
#'
#' Rhinogradentia is a fictitious order of mammal invented by German zoologist Gerolf Steiner. Members of the order, known as rhinogrades or snouters, are characterized by a nose-like feature called a nasorium, which evolved to fulfill a wide variety of functions in different species. Steiner also created a fictional persona, naturalist Harald Stümpke, who is credited as author of the 1957 book Bau und Leben der Rhinogradentia (translated into English in 1967 as The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades). According to Steiner, it is the only remaining record of the animals, which were wiped out, along with all the world's Rhinogradentia researchers, when the small Pacific archipelago they inhabited sank into the ocean due to nearby atomic bomb testing.
#'
#' Successfully mimicking a genuine scientific work, Rhinogradentia has appeared in several publications without any note of its fictitious nature, sometimes in connection with April Fools' Day.
#'
#' From the paper: we have a data frame with several snouter response variables (you can thing of those as different studies), of different types (continous, count, binary data). Explanatory variables are x, y rain, djungle!
