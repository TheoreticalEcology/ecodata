\description{
The data were obtained in a survey of students math and portuguese language courses in secondary school. It contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students. You can use it for some EDA or try to predict students final grade.

G3 - final grade (numeric: from 0 to 20, output target)

Additional note: there are several (382) students that belong to both datasets . These students can be identified by searching for identical attributes that characterize each student, as shown in the annexed R file.
